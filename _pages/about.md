I am a graduate student at University of Colorado, Boulder studying Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, with a speciality in microbial ecology. I use molecular and computational tools to study microbial communities. My research focuses on the environmental conditions which influence community assembly and the molecular mechanisms that underpin community functional traits.
