Over the years, I have created a number of pipelines, tools, and resources for bioinformatics and computation analyses. Often I begin by creating theses tools for myself and end up sharing them with people. The following is a (non-comprehensive) list of links to some of these resources. 

### Microbial Ecology Resources
* A dada2 pipeline for the amplicon analyses in Fierer Lab: [link](https://github.com/fiererlab/dada2_fiererlab)

* COMING SOON: Metagenomics Pipeline

### General Resources
* Quick 'N Dirty guide to Git: [link](https://github.com/hhollandmoritz/git_guide)

* Templates for Common R Analyses: [link](https://github.com/hhollandmoritz/CommonRCode)

* Knitting and spinning R projects: [link](https://github.com/hhollandmoritz/Useful_templates)
