Over the years, I have created a number of pipelines, tools, and resources for bioinformatics and computation analyses. Often I begin by creating these tools for myself and end up sharing them with people. The following is a (non-comprehensive) list of links to some of these resources. 

### General Resources
* Automating Workflows with Make (emphasis on R-based workflows): [link](https://github.com/hhollandmoritz/AutomatingWorkflowsWithMake)

* Knitting and spinning R projects: [link](https://github.com/hhollandmoritz/Useful_templates)
