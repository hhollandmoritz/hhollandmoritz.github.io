Scientists are regularly called upon to exercise our creativity in identifying problems, new ideas, and finding creative solutions to those problems. Although this is a critical part of our job we have little formal training in the generation of new ideas or efficient techniques to link disparate concepts and come up with innovative ideas in short amounts of time. Luckily, techniques to enhance creative thinking can be taught and our friends in the fields of Design and Art have been training students in them for years. 

In the future, I will place materials from a course designed to train scientists to think creatively.
