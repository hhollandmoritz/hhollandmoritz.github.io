1. the terminal - bash
2. data organization
3. R - data visualization, statistics, organization all in one great programming language. 

4. A programming language - learn about loops, functions, if/then statements, and learn to think like a computer. 
  + R - great for data visualization, statistics, working with data tables
  + python - more versatile than R, but might be a bit harder to learn the statistics or data visualization straight off the bat.
