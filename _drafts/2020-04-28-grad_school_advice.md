1. You will fail (and it's Totally Fine)
2. Have multiple plans - It's not enough just to prepare to go into academia or industry.
3. Skills not projects - Grad school is focused around projects or thesis chapters but a healthier way to think of it is as a gaining a set of skills over 5 years.
4. You are an employee - for those graduate students who have had the opportunity to work before grad school, you probably don't need to hear this, but for students who have never held a real job, being an employee comes with responsibility but also rights. 
5. Invest time to learn the "soft skills" - You will never have career services again. Take advanatage!
6. Learn to advocate for yourself - it's easy to feel like an impostor in graduate school - don't let impostor syndrome keep you from getting the credit you deserve and the protection that you need.
7. Invest time to figure out the best way to communicate with your advisor. Then do it often. 
 + advisors are only human and many have never been trained in management. This often means that they might be lacking in some typical skills one might want in a boss. 
 
You are your closest collaborator. You will spend your graduate career working on projects that you decided on early when you didn't know very much and when you didn't have very many skills. That's okay. But knowing that, you'll want to try to be the best collaborator you can be. Keep copious notes, come up with alternative plans, keep in mind that your vision of your thesis now will be different from what your thesis actually is.
