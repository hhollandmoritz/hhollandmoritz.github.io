I"ù<p>Soil is teaming with life. In this project we aim to idenfity and characterize the ecological distribution of the most abundant genes of unknown function present in soils. Through this project we hope to gain a better understanding of the genetic basis of common ecological traits in soil microbial communities.</p>
