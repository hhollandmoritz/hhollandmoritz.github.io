    <p><b>Background:</b> Mosses in high latitude ecosystems harbor diverse bacterial taxa, including N<sub>2</sub>-fixers which are key contributors to nitrogen dynamics in these systems. Yet, the relative importance of moss host species, and environmental factors, in structuring these microbial communities and their N<sub>2</sub>-fixing potential remains unclear. We studied 26 boreal and tundra moss species across 24 sites in Alaska, USA from 61¬∞ to 69¬∞ N. We used cultivation-independent approaches to characterize the variation in moss-associated bacterial communities as a function of host species identity and site characteristics. We also measured N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates via <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> isotopic enrichment and identified potential N<sub>2</sub>-fixing bacteria using available literature and genomic information. <br /><b>Results:</b> Host species identity and host evolutionary history were both highly predictive of moss microbiome composition, highlighting strong phylogenetic coherence in these microbial communities. Although less important, light availability and temperature also influenced composition of the moss microbiome. Finally, we identified putative N<sub>2</sub>-fixing bacteria specific to some moss hosts, including potential N<sub>2</sub>-fixing bacteria outside well-studied cyanobacterial clades. <br /><b>Conclusions:</b> The strong effect of host identity on moss-associated bacterial communities demonstrates mosses‚Äô utility for understanding plant-microbe interactions in non-leguminous systems. Our work also highlights the likely importance of novel bacterial taxa to N<sub>2</sub>-fixation in high-latitude ecosystems.</p>

    <p>Moss-associated N<sub>2</sub> fixation provides a substantial but heterogeneous input of new N to nutrient-limited ecosystems at high latitudes. In spite of the broad diversity of mosses found in boreal and Arctic ecosystems, the extent to which host moss identity drives variation in N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates remains largely undetermined. We used <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> incubations to quantify the fixation rates associated with 34 moss species from 24 sites ranging from 60¬∞ to 68¬∞ N in Alaska, USA. Remarkably, all sampled moss genera fixed N<sub>2</sub>, including well-studied feather and peat mosses and genera such as Tomentypnum, Dicranum, and Polytrichum. The total moss-associated N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates ranged from almost zero to 3.2 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, with an average of 0.8 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, based on abundance-weighted averages of all mosses summed for each site. Random forest models indicated that moss taxonomic family was a better predictor of rate variation across Alaska than any of the measured environmental factors, including site, pH, tree density, and mean annual precipitation and temperature. Consistent with this finding, mixed models showed that trends in N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates among moss genera were consistent across biomes. We also found ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù of high fixation rates in one-fourth of sampled sites. Our results demonstrated the importance of moss identity in influencing N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates. This in turn indicates the potential utility of moss identity when making ecosystem N input predictions and exploring other sources of process rate variation.</p>

    <p>Summary Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)-fixing moss microbial communities play key roles in nitrogen cycling of boreal forests. Forest type and leaf litter inputs regulate moss abundance, but how they control moss microbiomes and N<sub>2</sub>-fixation remains understudied. We examined impacts of forest type and broadleaf litter on microbial community composition and N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates of <i>Hylocomium splendens</i> and <i>Pleurozium schreberi</i>. We conducted a moss transplant and leaf litter manipulation experiment at three sites with paired paper birch (<i>Betula neoalaskana</i>) and black spruce (<i>Picea mariana</i>) stands in Alaska. We characterized bacterial communities using marker gene sequencing, determined N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates using stable isotopes (<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>), and measured environmental covariates. Mosses native to and transplanted into spruce stands supported generally higher N<sub>2</sub>-fixation and distinct microbial communities compared to similar treatments in birch stands. High leaf litter inputs shifted microbial community composition for both moss species and reduced N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates for <i>H. splendens</i>, which had the highest rates. N<sub>2</sub>-fixation was positively associated with several bacterial taxa, including cyanobacteria. The moss microbiome and environmental conditions controlled N<sub>2</sub>-fixation at the stand- and transplant-scales. Predicted shifts from spruce- to deciduous-dominated stands will interact with the relative abundances of mosses supporting different microbiomes and N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates, which could affect stand-level N inputs.</p>

    <p>Few studies have comprehensively investigated the temporal variability in soil microbial communities despite widespread recognition that the belowground environment is dynamic. In part, this stems from the challenges associated with the high degree of spatial heterogeneity in soil microbial communities and because the presence of relic DNA (DNA from dead cells or secreted extracellular DNA) may dampen temporal signals. Here, we disentangle the relationships among spatial, temporal, and relic DNA effects on prokaryotic and fungal communities in soils collected from contrasting hillslopes in Colorado, USA. We intensively sampled plots on each hillslope over 6 months to discriminate between temporal variability, intraplot spatial heterogeneity, and relic DNA effects on the soil prokaryotic and fungal communities. We show that the intraplot spatial variability in microbial community composition was strong and independent of relic DNA effects and that these spatial patterns persisted throughout the study. When controlling for intraplot spatial variability, we identified significant temporal variability in both plots over the 6-month study. These microbial communities were more dissimilar over time after relic DNA was removed, suggesting that relic DNA hinders the detection of important temporal dynamics in belowground microbial communities. We identified microbial taxa that exhibited shared temporal responses and show that these responses were often predictable from temporal changes in soil conditions. Our findings highlight approaches that can be used to better characterize temporal shifts in soil microbial communities, information that is critical for predicting the environmental preferences of individual soil microbial taxa and identifying linkages between soil microbial community composition and belowground processes.IMPORTANCE Nearly all microbial communities are dynamic in time. Understanding how temporal dynamics in microbial community structure affect soil biogeochemistry and fertility are key to being able to predict the responses of the soil microbiome to environmental perturbations. Here, we explain the effects of soil spatial structure and relic DNA on the determination of microbial community fluctuations over time. We found that intensive spatial sampling was required to identify temporal effects in microbial communities because of the high degree of spatial heterogeneity in soil and that DNA from nonliving sources masks important temporal patterns. We identified groups of microbes with shared temporal responses and show that these patterns were predictable from changes in soil characteristics. These results provide insight into the environmental preferences and temporal relationships between individual microbial taxa and highlight the importance of considering relic DNA when trying to detect temporal dynamics in belowground communities.</p>

    <p>Genome-resolved environmental metagenomic sequencing has uncovered substantial previously unrecognized microbial diversity relevant for understanding the ecology and evolution of the biosphere, providing a more nuanced view of the distribution and ecological significance of traits including phototrophy across diverse niches. Recently, the capacity for bacteriochlorophyll-based anoxygenic photosynthesis has been proposed in the uncultured bacterial WPS-2 phylum (recently proposed as Candidatus Eremiobacterota) that are in close association with boreal moss. Here, we use phylogenomic analysis to investigate the diversity and evolution of phototrophic WPS-2. We demonstrate that phototrophic WPS-2 show significant genetic and metabolic divergence from other phototrophic and non-phototrophic lineages. The genomes of these organisms encode a new family of anoxygenic Type II photochemical reaction centers and other phototrophy-related proteins that are both phylogenetically and structurally distinct from those found in previously described phototrophs. We propose the name Candidatus Baltobacterales for the order-level aerobic WPS-2 clade which contains phototrophic lineages, from the Greek for ‚Äúbog‚Äù or ‚Äúswamp,‚Äù in reference to the typical habitat of phototrophic members of this clade.</p>

    <p>Mosses are critical components of boreal ecosystems where they typically account for a large proportion of net primary productivity and harbour diverse bacterial communities that can be the major source of biologically-fixed nitrogen in these ecosystems. Despite their ecological importance, we have limited understanding of how microbial communities vary across boreal moss species and the extent to which local site conditions may influence the composition of these bacterial communities. We used marker gene sequencing to analyze bacterial communities associated with seven boreal moss species collected near Fairbanks, AK, USA. We found that host identity was more important than site in determining bacterial community composition and that mosses harbour diverse lineages of potential N2 -fixers as well as an abundance of novel taxa assigned to understudied bacterial phyla (including candidate phylum WPS-2). We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to assemble genomes from the WPS-2 candidate phylum and found that these moss-associated bacteria are likely anoxygenic phototrophs capable of carbon fixation via RuBisCo with an ability to utilize byproducts of photorespiration from hosts via a glyoxylate shunt. These results give new insights into the metabolic capabilities of understudied bacterial lineages that associate with mosses and the importance of plant hosts in shaping their microbiomes.</p>

    <p>Asphalts, biochemically degraded oil, contain persistent, water-soluble compounds that pose a significant challenge to the isolation of PCR quality DNA. The adaptation of existing DNA purification protocols and commercial kits proved unsuccessful at overcoming this hurdle. Treatment of aqueous asphalt extracts with a polyamide resin afforded genomic microbial DNA templates that could readily be amplified by PCR. Physicochemically distinct asphalt samples from five natural oil seeps successfully generated the expected 291bp amplicons targeting a region of the 16S rRNA gene, illustrating the robustness of the method. DNA recovery yields were in the 50‚Äì80% range depending on how the asphalt sample was seeded with exogenous DNA. The scope of the new method was expanded to include soil with high humic acid content. DNA from soil samples spiked with a range of humic acid concentrations was extracted with a commercial kit followed by treatment with the polyamide resin. The additional step significantly improved the purity of the DNA templates, especially at high humic acid concentrations, based on qPCR analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The new method has the advantages of being inexpensive, simple, and rapid and should provide a valuable addition to protocols in the field of petroleum and soil microbiology.</p>
