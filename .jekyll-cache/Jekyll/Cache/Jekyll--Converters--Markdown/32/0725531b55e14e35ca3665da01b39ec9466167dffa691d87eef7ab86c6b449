I"Å<p>Mosses play critical roles in boreal and arctic ecosystems. In this project we aim to understand the structure and function of the moss microbial community, the extent to which it is predicitable from moss phylogeny and how microbial community structure influences nitrogen mineralization rates.</p>

    Mosses are ubiquitous in high-latitude systems, above are just three examples of common species <i>Pleurozium schreberi</i>, <i>Polytrichum spp.</i>, and <i>Hylocomium splendens</i>. <i>Hylocomium splendens</i> and <i>Pleurozium schreberi</i>, known as feather mosses host microbes that are a primary source of fixed nitrogen in the boreal forest.

<h3 id="findings">Findings</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Microbial communities of boreal mosses are more influenced shaped by their host than by their local site conditions.</li>
  <li>Nitrogen fixation happens on all moss species weâ€™ve studied, including those not typically known for nitrogen fixation (i.e. <i>Dicranum</i>).</li>
  <li>Boreal mosses are dominated by a surprising diversity of bacteria, including phyla that are understudied such as Candidate Phylum WPS-2, and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i>.</li>
</ul>
