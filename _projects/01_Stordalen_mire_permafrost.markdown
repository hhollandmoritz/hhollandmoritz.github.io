Our climate is changing rapidly, leading to thawing of the permafrost in northern latitudes. Microbes play important roles in northern soils contributing to carbon sequestration and release in complex ways that are not fully understood. When permafrost thaws, microbial communities undergo major structural shifts which makes predicting the outcomes of that thaw on global carbon cycles challenging. This project aims to understand the effect of this thaw on microbial communities and to develop models to better predict the outcomes for microbial communities and landscape-level carbon cycles in northern ecoystems.
