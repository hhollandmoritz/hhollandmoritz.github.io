	title = {Aligning theoretical and empirical representations of soil carbon-to-nitrogen stoichiometry with process-based terrestrial biogeochemistry models},
	year = {2023},
	abstract = {Soil carbon-nitrogen stoichiometry (C:N) acts as a control over decomposition and soil organic matter formation and loss, making it a key soil property for understanding ecosystem dynamics. It is such a dominant feature of ecosystem function that soil C:N is parameterized in Earth System Models that are used to predict how ecosystems will behave under global environmental change. However, the controls of soil C:N and how they respond to increasing pressures from global change agents are not fully understood. The “foundational” controls on soil C:N, namely plant and microbial C:N, have been used to predict soil C:N, but fail to accurately simulate all ecosystems and may be insufficient for predictions under global environmental change. We present an “emerging” representation of controls of soil C:N that includes plant-microbe-mineral feedbacks that have been shown to regulate soil C:N. We argue that including representation of these emerging drivers in process-based terrestrial biogeochemistry models, which include biological N fixation, mycorrhizae, priming, root exudation of organic acids, and mineralogy, will improve mechanistic representation of soil C:N and associated processes. Such improvements will produce models that will better simulate a variety of ecological states and predict soil C:N when global changes modify plant-microbe-mineral interactions. Here, we align our empirical understanding of controls of soil C:N with those controls represented in models, and show that implementing emerging drivers of soil C:N results in different simulated outcomes at steady state and in response to elevated CO2. Our review and preliminary simulations support the need to incorporate emerging drivers of soil C:N into process-based terrestrial biogeochemistry models, allowing for both theoretical exploration of mechanisms and potentially more accurate predictions of land biogeochemical responses to global change.},

	title = {Topographic Heterogeneity and Aspect Moderate Exposure to Climate Change Across an Alpine Tundra Hillslope},
	year = {2023},
	abstract = {Alpine tundra ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate warming but are governed by local-scale abiotic heterogeneity, which makes it difficult to predict tundra responses to environmental change. Although land models are typically implemented at global scales, they can be applied at local scales to address process-based ecological questions. In this study, we ran ecosystem-scale Community Land Model (CLM) simulations with a novel hillslope hydrology configuration to represent topographically heterogeneous alpine tundra vegetation across a moisture gradient at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, USA. We used local observations to evaluate our simulations and investigated the role of topography and aspect in mediating patterns of snow, productivity, soil moisture, and soil temperature, as well as the potential exposure to climate change across an alpine tundra hillslope. Overall, our simulations captured observed gradients in abiotic conditions and productivity among heterogeneous, hydrologically connected vegetation communities (moist, wet, and dry). We found that south facing aspects were characterized by reduced snowpack and drier and warmer soils in all communities. When we extended our simulations to the year 2100, we found that earlier snowmelt altered the timing of runoff, with cascading effects on soil moisture, productivity, and growing season length. However, these effects were not distributed equally across the tundra, highlighting potential vulnerabilities of alpine vegetation in dry, wind-scoured, and south facing areas. Overall, our results demonstrate how land model outputs can be applied to advance process-based understanding of climate change impacts on ecosystem function.},

	title = {Conversion to managed land uses reduces soil carbon stocks and alters microbial community structure and function in a subtropical Atlantic Forest},
	year = {2023},
	abstract = {Soil carbon (C) sequestration has been proposed as an alternative to mitigate the effects of climate change and to guarantee food safety. However, forest conversion to managed land uses has depleted soil C stocks and affected soil microbial community function and composition, potentially impacting a wide range of ecosystem services. Our objective was to investigate the effect of forest conversion to intensive land uses (pasture, cropland) on soil C dynamics and soil microbial community structure and function in the subtropical portion of the Atlantic Forest biome, one of the world’s most critical hotspots of biodiversity. For that, we evaluated four land uses - forest fragment, grassland, and agriculture with five or fifty years of cultivation. We analyzed soil C pools, edaphic variables, and soil bacterial/archaeal (16S) and fungal (ITS) communities. Forest conversion to anthropogenic land uses reduced soil C stocks and altered soil C dynamics. Bacterial/archaeal and fungal community composition was strongly correlated with pH, base saturation, and calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) content. However, soil C pools were not associated with potential extracellular enzyme activity or microbial diversity. Finally, we identified microbes that were positively correlated with soil C stocks, potentially representing indicators of soil C storage. Our study indicates that land use change results in edaphic alterations with implications to soil C dynamics and microbial communities in the subtropical region of the Atlantic Forest biome.},

	doi = {10.1101/2021.12.02.470747},
	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {Genes that remain hypothetical, uncharacterized, and unannotated comprise a substantial portion of metagenomic datasets and are likely to be particularly prevalent in soils where poorly characterized taxa predominate. Documenting the prevalence, distribution, and potential roles of these genes of unknown function is an important first step to understanding their functional contributions in soil communities. We identified genes of unknown function from 50 soil metagenomes and analyzed their environmental distributions and ecological associations. We found that genes of unknown function are prevalent in soils, particularly fine-textured, higher pH soils that harbor greater abundances of Crenarchaeota, Gemmatimonadota, Nitrospirota, and Methylomirabilota. We identified 43 dominant (abundant and ubiquitous) gene clusters of unknown function and determined their associations with soil microbial phyla and other "known" genes. We found that these dominant unknown genes were commonly associated with microbial phyla that are relatively uncharacterized, with the majority of these dominant unknown genes associated with mobile genetic elements. This work demonstrates a strategy for investigating genes of unknown function in soils, emphasizes the biological insights that can be learned by adopting this strategy, and highlights specific hypotheses that warrant further investigation regarding the functional roles of abundant and ubiquitous genes of unknown function in soil metagenomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
