	abstract = {Genes that remain hypothetical, uncharacterized, and unannotated comprise a substantial portion of metagenomic datasets and are likely to be particularly prevalent in soils where poorly characterized taxa predominate. Documenting the prevalence, distribution, and potential roles of these genes of unknown function is an important first step to understanding their functional contributions in soil communities. We identified genes of unknown function from 50 soil metagenomes and analyzed their environmental distributions and ecological associations. We found that genes of unknown function are prevalent in soils, particularly fine-textured, higher pH soils that harbor greater abundances of Crenarchaeota, Gemmatimonadota, Nitrospirota, and Methylomirabilota. We identified 43 dominant (abundant and ubiquitous) gene clusters of unknown function and determined their associations with soil microbial phyla and other "known" genes. We found that these dominant unknown genes were commonly associated with microbial phyla that are relatively uncharacterized, with the majority of these dominant unknown genes associated with mobile genetic elements. This work demonstrates a strategy for investigating genes of unknown function in soils, emphasizes the biological insights that can be learned by adopting this strategy, and highlights specific hypotheses that warrant further investigation regarding the functional roles of abundant and ubiquitous genes of unknown function in soil metagenomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
