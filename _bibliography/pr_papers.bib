abstract = { Antarctic soils represent an ideal system to study how environmental properties shape the taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial communities given the relatively low diversity of Antarctic soil microbial communities and the pronounced environmental gradients that occur across soils located in reasonable proximity to one another. Moreover, the challenging environmental conditions typical of most Antarctic soils present an opportunity to investigate the traits that allow soil microbes to persist in some of the most inhospitable habitats on Earth. The inland soils found on the Antarctic continent represent one of the more challenging environments for microbial life on Earth. Nevertheless, Antarctic soils harbor unique bacterial and archaeal (prokaryotic) communities able to cope with extremely cold and dry conditions. These communities are not homogeneous, and the taxonomic composition and functional capabilities (genomic attributes) of these communities across environmental gradients remain largely undetermined. We analyzed the prokaryotic communities in soil samples collected from across the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica by coupling quantitative PCR, marker gene amplicon sequencing, and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that elevation was the dominant factor explaining differences in the structures of the soil prokaryotic communities, with the drier and saltier soils found at higher elevations harboring less diverse communities and unique assemblages of cooccurring taxa. The higher-elevation soil communities also had lower maximum potential growth rates (as inferred from metagenome-based estimates of codon usage bias) and an overrepresentation of genes associated with trace gas metabolism. Together, these results highlight the utility of assessing community shifts across pronounced environmental gradients to improve our understanding of the microbial diversity found in Antarctic soils and the strategies used by soil microbes to persist at the limits of habitability. IMPORTANCE Antarctic soils represent an ideal system to study how environmental properties shape the taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial communities given the relatively low diversity of Antarctic soil microbial communities and the pronounced environmental gradients that occur across soils located in reasonable proximity to one another. Moreover, the challenging environmental conditions typical of most Antarctic soils present an opportunity to investigate the traits that allow soil microbes to persist in some of the most inhospitable habitats on Earth. We used cultivation-independent methods to study the bacterial and archaeal communities found in soil samples collected from across the Shackleton Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains. We show that those environmental characteristics associated with elevation have the greatest impact on the structure of these microbial communities, with the colder, drier, and saltier soils found at higher elevations sustaining less diverse communities that were distinct from those in more hospitable soils with respect to their composition, genomic attributes, and overall life-history strategies. Notably, the harsher conditions found in higher-elevation soils likely select for taxa with lower maximum potential growth rates and an increased reliance on trace gas metabolism to support growth. },

abstract={From the aboveground vegetation to the belowground microbes, terrestrial communities differ between the highly divergent alpine (above treeline) and subalpine (below treeline) ecosystems. Yet, much less is known about the partitioning of microbial communities between alpine and subalpine lakes. Our goal was to determine whether the composition of bacterioplankton communities of high-elevation mountain lakes differed across treeline, identify key players in driving the community composition, and identify potential environmental factors that may be driving differences. To do so, we compared bacterial community composition (using 16S rDNA sequencing) of alpine and subalpine lakes in the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion at two time points: once in the early summer and once in the late summer. In the early summer (July), shortly after peak runoff, bacterial communities of alpine lakes were distinct from subalpine lakes. Interestingly, by the end of the summer (approximately 5 weeks after the first visit in August), bacterial communities of alpine and subalpine lakes were no longer distinct. Several bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were also identified as key players by significantly contributing to the community dissimilarity. The community divergence across treeline found in the early summer was correlated with several environmental factors, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN). In this paper, we offer several potential scenarios driven by both biotic and abiotic factors that could lead to the observed patterns. While the mechanisms for these patterns are yet to be determined, the community dissimilarity in the early summer correlates with the timing of increased hydrologic connections with the terrestrial environment. Springtime snowmelt brings the flushing of mountain watersheds that connects terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This connectivity declines precipitously throughout the summer after snowmelt is complete. Regional climate change is predicted to bring alterations to precipitation and snowpack, which can modify the flushing of solutes, nutrients, and terrestrial microbes into lakes. Future preservation of the unique alpine lake ecosystem is dependent on a better understanding of ecosystem partitioning across treeline and careful consideration of terrestrial-aquatic connections in mountain watersheds.},

abstract = {Moss-associated N<sub>2</sub> fixation by epiphytic microbes is a key biogeochemical process in nutrient-limited high-latitude ecosystems. Abiotic drivers, such as temperature and moisture, and the identity of host mosses are critical sources of variation in N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates. An understanding of the potential interaction between these factors is essential for predicting N inputs as moss communities change with the climate. To further understand the drivers and results of N<sub>2</sub> fixation rate variation, we obtained natural abundance values of C and N isotopes and an associated rate of N<sub>2</sub> fixation with <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> gas incubations in 34 moss species collected in three regions across Alaska, USA. We hypothesized that &delta;<sup>15</sup>N values would increase toward 0‰ with higher N<sub>2</sub> fixation to reflect the increasing contribution of fixed N<sub>2</sub> in moss biomass. Second, we hypothesized that &delta;<sup>13</sup>C and N<sub>2</sub> fixation would be positively related, as enriched &delta;<sup>13</sup>C signatures reflect abiotic conditions favorable to N<sub>2</sub> fixation. We expected that the magnitude of these relationships would vary among types of host mosses, reflecting differences in anatomy and habitat. We found little support for our first hypothesis, with only a modest positive relationship between N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates and &delta;<sup>15</sup>N in a structural equation model. We found a significant positive relationship between &delta;<sup>13</sup>C and N<sub>2</sub> fixation only in Hypnales, where the probability of N<sub>2</sub> fixation activity reached 95% when &delta;<sup>13</sup>C values exceeded − 30.4‰. We conclude that moisture and temperature interact strongly with host moss identity in determining the extent to which abiotic conditions impact associated N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates.},

  abstract= {Moss-associated N<sub>2</sub> fixation provides a substantial but heterogeneous input of new N to nutrient-limited ecosystems at high latitudes. In spite of the broad diversity of mosses found in boreal and Arctic ecosystems, the extent to which host moss identity drives variation in N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates remains largely undetermined. We used <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> incubations to quantify the fixation rates associated with 34 moss species from 24 sites ranging from 60° to 68° N in Alaska, USA. Remarkably, all sampled moss genera fixed N<sub>2</sub>, including well-studied feather and peat mosses and genera such as Tomentypnum, Dicranum, and Polytrichum. The total moss-associated N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates ranged from almost zero to 3.2 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, with an average of 0.8 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, based on abundance-weighted averages of all mosses summed for each site. Random forest models indicated that moss taxonomic family was a better predictor of rate variation across Alaska than any of the measured environmental factors, including site, pH, tree density, and mean annual precipitation and temperature. Consistent with this finding, mixed models showed that trends in N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates among moss genera were consistent across biomes. We also found “hotspots” of high fixation rates in one-fourth of sampled sites. Our results demonstrated the importance of moss identity in influencing N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates. This in turn indicates the potential utility of moss identity when making ecosystem N input predictions and exploring other sources of process rate variation.},

Forest type and leaf litter inputs regulate moss abundance, but how they control moss microbiomes and N<sub>2</sub>-fixation remains understudied. We examined impacts of forest type and broadleaf litter on microbial community composition and N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates of <i>Hylocomium splendens</i> and <i>Pleurozium schreberi</i>. We conducted a moss transplant and leaf litter manipulation experiment at three sites with paired paper birch (<i>Betula neoalaskana</i>) and black spruce (<i>Picea mariana</i>) stands in Alaska. We characterized bacterial communities using marker gene sequencing, determined N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates using stable isotopes (<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>), and measured environmental covariates. Mosses native to and transplanted into spruce stands supported generally higher N<sub>2</sub>-fixation and distinct microbial communities compared to similar treatments in birch stands. High leaf litter inputs shifted microbial community composition for both moss species and reduced N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates for <i>H. splendens</i>, which had the highest rates. N<sub>2</sub>-fixation was positively associated with several bacterial taxa, including cyanobacteria. The moss microbiome and environmental conditions controlled N<sub>2</sub>-fixation at the stand- and transplant-scales. Predicted shifts from spruce- to deciduous-dominated stands will interact with the relative abundances of mosses supporting different microbiomes and N<sub>2</sub>-fixation rates, which could affect stand-level N inputs.},

The adaptation of existing DNA purification protocols and commercial kits proved unsuccessful at overcoming this hurdle. Treatment of aqueous asphalt extracts with a polyamide resin afforded genomic microbial DNA templates that could readily be amplified by PCR. Physicochemically distinct asphalt samples from five natural oil seeps successfully generated the expected 291bp amplicons targeting a region of the 16S rRNA gene, illustrating the robustness of the method. DNA recovery yields were in the 50–80% range depending on how the asphalt sample was seeded with exogenous DNA. The scope of the new method was expanded to include soil with high humic acid content. DNA from soil samples spiked with a range of humic acid concentrations was extracted with a commercial kit followed by treatment with the polyamide resin. The additional step significantly improved the purity of the DNA templates, especially at high humic acid concentrations, based on qPCR analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The new method has the advantages of being inexpensive, simple, and rapid and should provide a valuable addition to protocols in the field of petroleum and soil microbiology.},

  abstract={Mosses are critical components of boreal ecosystems where they typically account for a large proportion of net primary productivity and harbour diverse bacterial communities that can be the major source of biologically-fixed nitrogen in these ecosystems. Despite their ecological importance, we have limited understanding of how microbial communities vary across boreal moss species and the extent to which local site conditions may influence the composition of these bacterial communities. We used marker gene sequencing to analyze bacterial communities associated with seven boreal moss species collected near Fairbanks, AK, USA. We found that host identity was more important than site in determining bacterial community composition and that mosses harbour diverse lineages of potential N<sub>2</sub> -fixers as well as an abundance of novel taxa assigned to understudied bacterial phyla (including candidate phylum WPS-2). We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to assemble genomes from the WPS-2 candidate phylum and found that these moss-associated bacteria are likely anoxygenic phototrophs capable of carbon fixation via RuBisCo with an ability to utilize byproducts of photorespiration from hosts via a glyoxylate shunt. These results give new insights into the metabolic capabilities of understudied bacterial lineages that associate with mosses and the importance of plant hosts in shaping their microbiomes.},

ABSTRACT={Genome-resolved environmental metagenomic sequencing has uncovered substantial previously unrecognized microbial diversity relevant for understanding the ecology and evolution of the biosphere, providing a more nuanced view of the distribution and ecological significance of traits including phototrophy across diverse niches. Recently, the capacity for bacteriochlorophyll-based anoxygenic photosynthesis has been proposed in the uncultured bacterial WPS-2 phylum (recently proposed as Candidatus Eremiobacterota) that are in close association with boreal moss. Here, we use phylogenomic analysis to investigate the diversity and evolution of phototrophic WPS-2. We demonstrate that phototrophic WPS-2 show significant genetic and metabolic divergence from other phototrophic and non-phototrophic lineages. The genomes of these organisms encode a new family of anoxygenic Type II photochemical reaction centers and other phototrophy-related proteins that are both phylogenetically and structurally distinct from those found in previously described phototrophs. We propose the name Candidatus Baltobacterales for the order-level aerobic WPS-2 clade which contains phototrophic lineages, from the Greek for “bog” or “swamp,” in reference to the typical habitat of phototrophic members of this clade.},

	abstract = {Few studies have comprehensively investigated the temporal variability in soil microbial communities despite widespread recognition that the belowground environment is dynamic. In part, this stems from the challenges associated with the high degree of spatial heterogeneity in soil microbial communities and because the presence of relic DNA (DNA from dead cells or secreted extracellular DNA) may dampen temporal signals. Here, we disentangle the relationships among spatial, temporal, and relic DNA effects on prokaryotic and fungal communities in soils collected from contrasting hillslopes in Colorado, USA. We intensively sampled plots on each hillslope over 6 months to discriminate between temporal variability, intraplot spatial heterogeneity, and relic DNA effects on the soil prokaryotic and fungal communities. We show that the intraplot spatial variability in microbial community composition was strong and independent of relic DNA effects and that these spatial patterns persisted throughout the study. When controlling for intraplot spatial variability, we identified significant temporal variability in both plots over the 6-month study. These microbial communities were more dissimilar over time after relic DNA was removed, suggesting that relic DNA hinders the detection of important temporal dynamics in belowground microbial communities. We identified microbial taxa that exhibited shared temporal responses and show that these responses were often predictable from temporal changes in soil conditions. Our findings highlight approaches that can be used to better characterize temporal shifts in soil microbial communities, information that is critical for predicting the environmental preferences of individual soil microbial taxa and identifying linkages between soil microbial community composition and belowground processes.IMPORTANCE Nearly all microbial communities are dynamic in time. Understanding how temporal dynamics in microbial community structure affect soil biogeochemistry and fertility are key to being able to predict the responses of the soil microbiome to environmental perturbations. Here, we explain the effects of soil spatial structure and relic DNA on the determination of microbial community fluctuations over time. We found that intensive spatial sampling was required to identify temporal effects in microbial communities because of the high degree of spatial heterogeneity in soil and that DNA from nonliving sources masks important temporal patterns. We identified groups of microbes with shared temporal responses and show that these patterns were predictable from changes in soil characteristics. These results provide insight into the environmental preferences and temporal relationships between individual microbial taxa and highlight the importance of considering relic DNA when trying to detect temporal dynamics in belowground communities.},
